The goal of this, my first project, will be to further familiarize myself with
basic HTML usage and as well how to properly interface between GIT and GITHUB.
Additionally, to become familiar with best practices associated with committing as well
as adding notes to the commits that I create. Likely, I will have to review the basic Git usage lessons.
